## Project Goals:

- Utilizing Pareto Anywhere to capture temperature and humidity data from the Minew S1 BLE sensor.
- Visualizing real-time data on the ThingsBoard dashboard.
- Automating fan control based on temperature thresholds.
- Enabling manual fan control through a switch widget on the ThingsBoard dashboard.
- Display real-time temperature and humidity data on LCD screen.

## Tools & Hardware:

1. Raspberry Pi 4.
2. [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/).
3. [Minew S1 BLE Sensor](https://www.minew.com/product/s1-ble-temperature-and-humidity-sensor/).
4. ThingsBoard.
5. Woozoo Fan.
6. [IR LED DIODE](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/excelitas-technologies/VTE1291-1H/5885863) (used to transmit on/off signals to control the fan).
